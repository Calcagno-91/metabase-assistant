  <h1>Privacy Policy – Metabase Assistant</h1>
  <p>Metabase Assistant is a browser extension designed to help users create dashboards and cards in Metabase more efficiently.</p>

  <h2>What Information We Collect</h2>

  <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
  <p>The extension runs locally in your browser. It only interacts with the Metabase pages open in your browser and stores temporary settings or preferences using <code>chrome.storage</code>. It does not send any data to third-party services unless you explicitly configure it to connect to your own Metabase instance or local AI server.</p>

  <h2>Permissions Explained</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>storage</strong>: used to save extension preferences locally.</li>
    <li><strong>scripting, content_scripts</strong>: used to interact with Metabase pages only.</li>
    <li><strong>&lt;all_urls&gt;</strong>: needed to support any custom-hosted Metabase instance (e.g., company or local environments).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
